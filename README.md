> ...the librarian deduced that the Library is "total"-perfect, complete, and whole-and that its bookshelves contain all possible combinations of the twenty-two orthographic symbols (a number which, though unimaginably vast, is not infinite)-that is, all that is able to be expressed, in every language.
~ Jorge Luis Borges, "The Library of Babel"

## Babel
Personal paper storage and management system.

### TODO:
- [ ] Implement tag filtering for display
- [ ] Implement search functionality
- [ ] Stress test more arxiv links
- [ ] Think about how to deal with papers outside of arxiv, maybe somehow search for them based on title?
